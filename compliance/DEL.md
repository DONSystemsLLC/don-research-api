# DON Health Commons License - Designated Exclusion List (DEL)

**Purpose**: This registry identifies Prohibited Entities (PEs) that are explicitly excluded from using the Licensed Work under DHCL v0.1. Entities on this list exceed $50M annual revenue from pharmaceutical or biotechnology products and/or have demonstrated business models incompatible with the mission-aligned Commons.

**Legal Status**: This is a living document subject to quarterly updates. Entities may petition for removal via the dispute resolution process (see DHCL ยง10).

**Version Control**: Each update includes a SHA256 hash for integrity verification. All historical versions are maintained in this repository.

## Current DEL (v0.1-intent)

**Status**: Empty registry during intent draft phase. DEL will be populated during v1.0 ratification after legal counsel review.

**Methodology for Inclusion**:
1. **Automatic Inclusion**: Publicly traded pharma/biotech companies with >$50M annual revenue from drug/diagnostic sales
2. **Discretionary Inclusion**: Private companies with >$50M revenue verified via SEC filings, Bloomberg, or third-party sources
3. **Mission Misalignment**: Entities demonstrating business practices incompatible with public health (e.g., price gouging, blocking generic competition, predatory licensing)
4. **Court Orders**: Entities subject to legal injunctions related to healthcare fraud or DHCL violations

**Data Sources**:
- SEC EDGAR filings (10-K, 10-Q reports)
- Bloomberg terminal revenue data
- PharmaCompass industry databases
- Public financial statements for international entities
- Court records (healthcare fraud, antitrust violations)

## DEL Update Process

### Quarterly Review Cycle
1. **Data Collection** (Month 1 of each quarter): Scrape SEC filings, Bloomberg data, public financial statements
2. **Verification** (Month 2): Cross-reference revenue data across multiple sources, identify subsidiaries
3. **Draft Update** (Month 3): Prepare new DEL version with added/removed entities
4. **Public Comment** (30 days): Post draft DEL to GitHub, solicit community feedback
5. **Ratification**: Finalize DEL update with SHA256 hash, publish to repository

### Dispute Resolution (DHCL ยง10)
Entities may petition for removal from DEL if:
- Revenue data was inaccurate (provide corrected financial statements)
- Entity has undergone structural change (spin-off, divestiture, non-profit conversion)
- Mission alignment demonstrated (e.g., policy changes like voluntary drug price caps)

**Petition Process**:
1. Email legal@donsystems.com with subject "DEL Dispute: [Entity Name]"
2. Provide documentation (financial statements, corporate structure, policy changes)
3. DON Systems / DHCL governance committee reviews within 30 days
4. Decision published with rationale (approved / denied)
5. If approved, entity removed from DEL in next quarterly update

## SHA256 Hash Verification

Each DEL update includes a SHA256 hash for tamper detection. To verify:

```bash
# Generate hash of DEL JSON file
shasum -a 256 compliance/DEL.json

# Compare against hash in del_version metadata
cat compliance/DEL.json | jq '.sha256_hash'
```

**Version Control**: All historical DEL versions archived in `compliance/del_archive/` with git tags.

## DEL Access & API Integration

**Programmatic Access**:
```python
import requests

# Fetch current DEL
del_data = requests.get("https://api.donsystems.com/dhcl/del/latest").json()

# Check if entity is on DEL
def is_prohibited_entity(entity_name: str) -> bool:
    for entity in del_data['entities']:
        if entity_name.lower() in [entity['legal_name'].lower(), entity['common_name'].lower()]:
            return True
    return False
```

**API Endpoints** (planned for v1.0):
- `GET /dhcl/del/latest`: Current DEL version
- `GET /dhcl/del/{version}`: Historical DEL by version
- `GET /dhcl/del/entity/{entity_id}`: Specific entity details
- `POST /dhcl/del/dispute`: Submit dispute petition (requires authentication)

## Transparency & Accountability

**Public Audit Trail**:
- All DEL updates committed to public GitHub repository
- Version control history shows additions/removals with rationale
- Community can review and comment on draft updates
- SHA256 hashes prevent tampering

**Governance**:
- DEL maintained by DON Systems during v0.1-intent and v1.0 phases
- Future governance may transition to community committee (MAE representatives)
- Annual review of DEL criteria and revenue thresholds

**Privacy Considerations**:
- DEL includes only publicly available data (SEC filings, public financial statements)
- No personally identifiable information (individual executives, employees)
- Focus on corporate entities, not individuals
