- 10 major sections covering complete deployment lifecycle
- Prerequisites and initial setup
- Environment configuration
- Health checks and monitoring
- Scaling strategies
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Security hardening
- Cost optimization
- 14-item production readiness checklist

**Key Sections:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Repository requirements (`requirements.txt`, `main.py`, Python 3.11)
   - Render.com account setup with GitHub integration
   - Local testing validation

2. **Initial Deployment (5 Steps):**
   - Create New Web Service with GitHub connection
   - Configure service settings (name, region, branch, runtime)
   - Instance type selection with pricing table:
     - Free ($0) - Testing only
     - Starter ($7/mo) - Demos/prototypes
     - **Standard ($25/mo) - RECOMMENDED for academic research**
     - Pro ($85/mo) - High-throughput
     - Pro Plus ($175/mo) - Enterprise workloads
   - Environment variables configuration
   - Deployment execution (5-8 minutes)

3. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Required: `PYTHON_VERSION=3.11`, `PORT=8080`
   - DON Stack modes: `internal` (default) vs `http` (microservices)
   - Authentication: `DON_AUTHORIZED_INSTITUTIONS_JSON` (recommended Option 1) vs file path (Option 2)
   - Optional debugging: `LOG_LEVEL`, `WORKERS`, `TIMEOUT`

4. **Build & Start Commands:**
   - Default: `pip install -r requirements.txt` + `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
   - Production options: access logs, worker tuning, timeout configuration
   - Gunicorn alternative for high concurrency

5. **Health Check Configuration:**
   - Path: `/api/v1/health`
   - Intervals: 60 seconds
   - Failure threshold: 3 consecutive failures
   - Success threshold: 2 consecutive successes
   - Requirements: 200 status within 10s with valid JSON
   - Behavior: passing → routes traffic, failing → triggers restart with email alert
   - Restart policy: max 3 attempts per 10 minutes

6. **Scaling & Performance:**
   - **Vertical:** Upgrade instance tier when CPU >70% or memory >80%
   - **Horizontal:** 2-10 instances with round-robin load balancing (Standard+ tiers, 2× cost per instance)
   - **Auto-scaling:** Render Scale (enterprise) with 70% scale-up / 30% scale-down thresholds
   - **Optimization:** HTTP/2 (default), GZipMiddleware, Redis caching, connection pooling

7. **Monitoring & Alerts:**
   - Built-in Render metrics: CPU, memory, request count, response time, error rate (7-day retention)
   - Email alerts: health check failures (automatic), high CPU >80%, high memory >90%, high error rate >5%
   - External monitoring: UptimeRobot (60s intervals), Sentry error tracking (DSN integration), APM options (DataDog, New Relic)

8. **Troubleshooting (5 Common Issues):**
   - **Build Failures:** Missing dependencies, incompatible Python, conflicts, timeouts → add packages, set `PYTHON_VERSION`, `pip freeze`, retry
   - **Health Check Failures:** Port binding issues, import errors, config missing → check logs for "Address in use", `ModuleNotFoundError`, `KeyError`
   - **Authentication Failures:** Missing `DON_AUTHORIZED_INSTITUTIONS_JSON`, invalid JSON, token mismatch → set in Render encrypted vars, validate JSON, verify tokens
   - **High Memory/OOM:** Insufficient RAM for workload → upgrade Standard to Pro, optimize batch sizes, add memory limits, monitor with psutil
   - **Slow Response Times:** CPU/memory/network bottlenecks → check metrics, upgrade tier, enable HTTP/2 compression, profile application

9. **Security Hardening:**
   - **HTTPS/TLS:** Automatic on `*.onrender.com` with TLS 1.3, Let's Encrypt free SSL auto-renewal, custom domain requires paid plan
   - **Environment Variables:** Use encrypted vars, never commit secrets, rotate quarterly, don't log values, secret files for large configs (max 10KB)
   - **Network Security:** IP whitelisting (enterprise only), DDoS protection (built-in), CORS middleware configuration
   - **Dependency Security:** Dependabot automated updates, `safety check` manual audit

10. **Cost Optimization:**
    - Tier pricing with 20% savings on annual billing
    - 5 reduction strategies:
      1. Right-size instance (start Standard, monitor usage, downgrade if <30%)
      2. Optimize build times (use pip cache)
      3. Suspend non-production services when not in use
      4. Use free tier for testing before paid migration
      5. Annual billing ($240/year vs $300 monthly for Standard)
    - Monitoring costs: dashboard tracks instance hours, bandwidth (100GB free), build minutes (500 free), billing alerts at 50%/80%/100%

**Deployment Checklist (14 Items):**
- [ ] Environment variables configured (`PYTHON_VERSION`, `PORT`, `DON_STACK_MODE`, `DON_AUTHORIZED_INSTITUTIONS_JSON`)
- [ ] Health check endpoint returning 200 status
- [ ] Instance tier appropriate for expected load

## Test Suite Architecture

### Test-Driven Documentation (TDD) Methodology

The documentation suite was developed using TDD principles for all testable components:

1. **Test-First Approach:**
   - Write documentation validation tests before documentation content
   - Define success criteria (API examples must execute, endpoints must be documented, workflows must complete)
   - Run tests to verify documentation accuracy

2. **Continuous Validation:**
   - 57 automated tests ensure documentation remains accurate
   - Tests run against live API to validate examples
   - Coverage tracking ensures no endpoints are missed

3. **Three-Layer Test Structure:**
   - **API Example Tests (22 tests):** Validate Python + cURL examples from API_REFERENCE.md
   - **Endpoint Coverage Tests (20 tests):** Ensure all endpoints are documented with required sections
   - **Integration Tests (15 tests):** Validate TAMU genomics workflows execute successfully
