## Policy Overview

The DON Research API provides quantum-enhanced genomics processing capabilities to academic and research institutions while protecting proprietary DON Stack technology. This policy defines how data is handled, secured, and retained throughout the system lifecycle.

### Key Principles

1. **Academic Research First**: Data handling optimized for research reproducibility and collaboration
2. **IP Protection**: Proprietary algorithms protected while providing transparent computational services
3. **Minimal Data Retention**: Input data and results retained only as long as necessary
4. **Transparent Operations**: All data processing operations logged with trace identifiers
5. **Compliance by Design**: Built-in support for GDPR, HIPAA, and research ethics standards

### Scope

This policy applies to:
- All data submitted to DON Research API endpoints
- Compressed vectors and analysis results generated by the API
- Audit logs and usage tracking data
- Metadata associated with research projects

---

## Data Ownership & Rights

### Your Data Remains Yours

**DON Systems LLC maintains NO ownership claims over your research data.**

- **Input Data**: You retain full ownership of all genomics data submitted to the API
- **Processed Results**: Compressed vectors, search results, and analysis outputs belong to you
- **Metadata**: Project identifiers, trace IDs, and usage metrics are your intellectual property
- **Derived Works**: Any publications, patents, or discoveries using API results are solely yours

### DON Stack Algorithms

While you own your data and results, **DON Stack algorithms and implementations remain proprietary**:

- **DON-GPU**: Fractal clustering algorithms (patent-protected)
- **QAC**: Quantum Adjacency Code error correction methods (proprietary)
- **TACE**: Temporal Adjacency Collapse Engine (patent-protected)

**You may NOT**:
- Reverse-engineer DON Stack algorithms from API responses
- Replicate compression methods based on observed behavior
- Extract mathematical constants or parameters for external use
- Redistribute or sublicense access to DON Stack technology

**You MAY**:
- Publish research results obtained using the API (with attribution)
- Use compressed vectors in downstream analyses
- Share API-generated results with collaborators
- Include API methods in grant applications and publications

### Attribution Requirements

When publishing research using DON Research API, include:

```

## Data Retention & Storage

### Automatic Retention Policies

| Data Type | Retention Period | Cleanup Method | Override Option |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Input gene expression matrices** | 24 hours | Automatic deletion | Contact support for extended retention |
| **Compressed vectors (temporary)** | 24 hours | Automatic deletion | Use project_id for longer retention |
| **Vector databases** | 7 days | Automatic deletion | Rebuilt on demand |
| **Audit logs (trace_id)** | 90 days | Automatic archival | Extended retention for academic projects |
| **Usage tracking** | 1 year | Aggregated anonymization | Institution-level reporting only |
| **QAC models** | 30 days | Automatic deletion | Export models before expiration |
| **Job artifacts (async)** | 48 hours | Automatic deletion | Download results promptly |

### Storage Locations

**Primary Storage**: Render.com US-East infrastructure  
**Backup Storage**: None (no persistent backups of user data)  
**Temporary Processing**: In-memory processing with ephemeral disk cache  

### Data Minimization

The API implements data minimization by design:

1. **No Raw Data Storage**: Original H5AD files are processed and discarded within seconds
2. **Compressed-Only Retention**: Only compressed vectors retained temporarily
3. **Metadata-Only Logs**: Audit logs contain trace IDs and metrics, not actual data
4. **Memory-First Processing**: Most operations complete in-memory without disk writes

### Extended Retention for Research Projects

Academic institutions may request extended retention for active research projects:

**Eligibility Requirements**:
- Active academic institution with valid token
- IRB approval (if human subjects data)
- Project identifier (`project_id`) assigned to all operations
- Clear data retention justification

**Request Process**:
1. Email `research@donsystems.com` with project details
2. Include institution, PI name, project duration
3. Specify retention period needed (max 1 year)
4. Provide IRB approval documentation (if applicable)

**Extended Retention Terms**:
- Maximum 1 year retention for active projects
- Automatic deletion upon project completion
- No additional storage fees for academic research
- Monthly usage reports provided to PI

## Security Measures

### Transport Security

**HTTPS Only**: All API communication uses TLS 1.3 encryption
- Strong cipher suites (ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384)
- Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) enabled
- HSTS (Strict-Transport-Security) enforced
- Certificate pinning recommended for production clients

### Authentication & Authorization

**Token-Based Authentication**:
- 256-bit randomly generated bearer tokens
- One token per institution (no individual user tokens)
- Tokens transmitted via Authorization header only
- No token logging in plain text

**Rate Limiting**:
- Per-institution hourly limits (1000/hour academic, 100/hour demo)
- Prevents abuse and ensures fair resource allocation
- Automatic reset every hour (UTC)
- 429 responses include retry-after guidance

### Access Controls

**Endpoint-Level Security**:
- Public: `/health` (status check only, no sensitive data)
- Authenticated: All data processing endpoints require valid token
- No anonymous access to computational resources

**Data Isolation**:
- Multi-tenant architecture with logical isolation
- Each institution's data processed independently
- No cross-institution data access
- Memory isolation between concurrent requests

### Data Protection in Transit

**Request Encryption**:
- JSON payloads encrypted via HTTPS
- Large files (H5AD uploads) support chunked transfer encoding
- Compression supported (gzip, deflate) for efficiency

**Response Security**:
- Results encrypted in transit
- No caching of sensitive responses
- Cache-Control headers prevent intermediate caching

### Data Protection at Rest

**Temporary Storage**:
- Ephemeral disk storage (container-based)
- Automatic cleanup on container restart
- No long-term persistence layer

**Secrets Management**:
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Render.com encrypted environment variable storage

### Vulnerability Management

**Dependency Scanning**:
- Automated dependency updates (Dependabot)
- Regular security audits of Python packages
- CVE monitoring for critical vulnerabilities

**Code Security**:
- Input validation on all API endpoints
- SQL injection prevention (no SQL databases used)
- XSS prevention (JSON responses only, no HTML rendering)
