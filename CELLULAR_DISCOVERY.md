## Key Discovery: TACE Alpha as a Cell State Classifier

### The Pattern That Emerged

When we ran TACE on individual cells (not cluster averages), a **bimodal distribution** appeared:

- **Low Alpha Regime** (Î± < 0.3): 14.3% of cells, primarily from Cluster 0
- **High Alpha Regime** (Î± > 0.7): 74.3% of cells, from Clusters 1-6
- **Transition Zone** (0.3-0.7): 11.4% of cells

**This was NOT predicted - it emerged from the data.**

---

## What Distinguishes the Two Regimes?

### Mathematical Properties

**Low Alpha Cells (Cluster 0):**
- PCA norm: ~8.7 (mean)
- Alpha: 0.10-0.29
- Low variability (std = 0.83)
- Homogeneous population

**High Alpha Cells (Clusters 1-6):**
- PCA norm: ~14.2 (mean)
- Alpha: 0.70-0.90
- High variability (std = 5.03)
- Heterogeneous populations

**Key Correlation:** PCA Norm â†” Alpha: r = +0.44
- Moderate positive correlation
- Higher "signal strength" â†’ higher alpha
- Alpha encodes something about cell state intensity

---

## Biological Interpretation (Tentative)

### What Could This Mean?

**Cluster 0 (Low Alpha, 42.7% of cells):**
- Largest, most homogeneous cluster
- Lowest PCA norms (~8.7)
- Consistent low alpha values (0.10-0.29)
- **Hypothesis:** Quiescent or "ground state" cells?
  - T cells at rest
  - Low metabolic activity
  - Minimal gene expression variation

**Clusters 1-6 (High Alpha, 57.3% of cells):**
- Smaller, more heterogeneous clusters
- Higher PCA norms (~14.2)
- Variable high alpha values (0.70-0.90)
- **Hypothesis:** Activated or specialized states?
  - B cells, monocytes, NK cells, etc.
  - Higher metabolic activity
  - More diverse gene expression programs

---

## The Surprise: Cluster Centroids Masked the Pattern

### Why We Almost Missed This

**When averaging to cluster centroids:**
- All clusters showed Î± = 0.900 (uniform)
- No variation detected
- Pattern completely hidden

**When examining individual cells:**
- Bimodal distribution revealed
- Clear low/high alpha regimes
- Cluster 0 distinct from all others

**Lesson:** Aggregation can hide real patterns. Single-cell resolution matters.

## What TACE Alpha Might Encode

Based purely on the data patterns:

1. **Cell State "Energy"**
   - Low alpha = low PCA norm = quiet/resting state
   - High alpha = high PCA norm = active/specialized state
   - Moderate correlation (r = +0.44) suggests this relationship

2. **Population Homogeneity**
   - Cluster 0: all cells show low alpha consistently
   - Other clusters: mixed alpha values, more variable
   - Alpha might detect "settled" vs "dynamic" populations

3. **Functional Distinction**
   - Low alpha exclusive to one cluster (Cluster 0)
   - High alpha shared across multiple clusters (1-6)
   - Suggests low alpha is a specific biological state, not just noise

## Observed Cluster Relationships

### Similarity Analysis (PCA Space)

**Most Similar Clusters:**
- C1 â†” C5: similarity = 0.81 (strong relationship)
- C3 â†” C4: similarity = 0.61 (moderate relationship)

**Most Distinct:**
- C5 â†” C6: similarity = 0.11
- C1 â†” C6: similarity = 0.08

**Interpretation:** Even without cell type labels, we can see:
- Some clusters are clearly related (C1-C5, C3-C4)
- Cluster 6 (rarest, 0.6% of cells) is most distinct
- PCA captures meaningful biological variation

---

## Population Size Analysis

**Rare Population (Cluster 6: 15 cells, 0.6%):**
- Alpha range: 0.52-0.90
- PCA norms: 21-27 (highest in dataset)
- Most distinct from other clusters
- **Could represent:** Rare immune subset or transitional state

**Common Population (Cluster 0: 1,154 cells, 42.7%):**
- Alpha range: 0.10-0.29 (uniquely low)
- PCA norms: 7.8-8.9 (lowest in dataset)
- Most homogeneous cluster
- **Could represent:** Major resting T cell population

**Observation:** Population size doesn't predict alpha directly, but the largest cluster has uniquely low alpha values.

---

## Unexpected Findings

### 1. Single Value Dominance
- **67.1% of sampled cells** show exactly Î± = 0.900
- Not just "around 0.9" - exactly this value
- Suggests discrete state, not continuous spectrum
- Might indicate a computational threshold or biological ceiling

### 2. Cluster 0 Anomaly
- Only cluster showing low alpha regime
- Contains 42.7% of all cells
- Most internally consistent (low std)
- Clearly distinct from all other clusters

### 3. Bimodal, Not Uniform
- Cluster averages suggested uniformity (all 0.900)
- Individual cells revealed bimodality
- Intermediate values rare (11.4% in transition zone)
- Cells "choose" between two stable alpha states

---

## What We Still Don't Know

### Open Questions

1. **Why is Î± = 0.900 so common?**
   - Is this a mathematical attractor?
   - Biological saturation point?
   - Computational artifact?

2. **What makes Cluster 0 special?**
   - Why low alpha exclusively here?
   - Related to cell type or cell state?
   - Would we see this in other tissues?

3. **What's in the transition zone?**
   - 11.4% of cells show intermediate alpha (0.3-0.7)
   - Are these cells in transition?
   - Or a distinct stable state?

4. **Is this PCA-dependent?**
   - Strong correlation with PCA norm (r = +0.44)
   - Would other dimensional reductions show same pattern?
   - Is alpha encoding something about embedding space?

## Methodological Insights

### What Worked

âœ… **Individual cell analysis** revealed patterns hidden in averages  
âœ… **No theoretical priors** - let patterns emerge naturally  
âœ… **Multiple complementary views** (clusters, correlations, distributions)  
âœ… **Sampling strategy** captured population diversity

### What to Try Next

ðŸ”¬ **Cell type annotation** - map clusters to known immune cell types  
ðŸ”¬ **Gene expression analysis** - what genes distinguish low/high alpha?  
ðŸ”¬ **Trajectory analysis** - are transition cells moving between regimes?  
ðŸ”¬ **Other datasets** - does this pattern replicate?  
ðŸ”¬ **Perturbation** - what if we force alpha changes?

## Summary: What the Math Told Us

**Without imposing any theoretical framework, the data revealed:**

1. **Two Cell State Regimes**
   - Low alpha (Cluster 0): "quiet" cells with low PCA signatures
   - High alpha (Clusters 1-6): "active" cells with strong PCA signatures

2. **Bimodal Distribution**
   - Not a continuous spectrum
   - Cells occupy discrete alpha states
   - Transition zone exists but is rare

3. **Cluster 0 Uniqueness**
   - Largest cluster (42.7% of cells)
   - Exclusively low alpha
   - Most homogeneous population
   - Clearly distinct biological state

4. **Alpha-Norm Relationship**
   - Moderate positive correlation (r = +0.44)
   - Higher PCA "energy" â†’ higher alpha
   - Alpha might encode signal strength or activation state

5. **Rare Population Distinctness**
   - Cluster 6 (0.6% of cells) most different from others
   - Highest PCA norms (21-27)
   - High alpha regime (0.52-0.90)
   - Possibly rare immune subset

**The pattern was there all along - we just needed to look at individual cells instead of averages.**

## Next Steps

To understand what we've discovered:

1. **Validate with known biology** - annotate cell types, check if low alpha = resting T cells
2. **Replicate on other datasets** - does this pattern generalize?
3. **Perturb the system** - what changes alpha values?
4. **Connect to gene expression** - what genes distinguish the two regimes?
5. **Test predictions** - can alpha classify cell states in new data?

**The math has spoken. Now we need to understand what it's saying.**
